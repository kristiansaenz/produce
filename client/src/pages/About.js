                    <li> Become a farmer and sell home-grown/home-made goods </li>
                    <li> Whether its from your garden, freshly baked bread, cookies, eggs from your coop </li>
                    <li> Sign up to create your "booth" and customers can view your goods </li>
                    <li> As a customer, you can view booths by location and filter what type of goods you desire </li>
                    <li> As a customer, you can make offers on goods </li>
                    <li> Think of this similar to OfferUp customer / buyer relation, or like old time markets </li>
                    <li> As a customer, you can negotiate price and meet up with farmer to purchase goods </li>
