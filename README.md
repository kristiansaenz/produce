Produce is a web app that serves as a platform for farmers, garden hobbyists to advertise their home-grown produce and goods. You can sign up and create a booth to have your booth listed on the marketplace. If you don't want to make a booth, you can signup and follow your favorite booths to see what kind of new goods that they have in season.
